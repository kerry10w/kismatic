## kismatic upgrade

Upgrade your Kubernetes cluster

### Synopsis


Upgrade your Kubernetes cluster.

The upgrade process is applied to each node, one node at a time. If a private docker registry
is being used, the new container images will be pushed by Kismatic before starting to upgrade
nodes.

Nodes in the cluster are upgraded in the following order:

1. Etcd nodes
2. Master nodes
3. Worker nodes (regardless of specialization)


```
kismatic upgrade
```

### Options

```
      --dry-run                       simulate the upgrade, but don't actually upgrade the cluster
      --generated-assets-dir string   path to the directory where assets generated during the installation process will be stored (default "generated")
  -o, --output string                 installation output format (options "simple"|"raw") (default "simple")
      --partial-ok                    allow the upgrade of ready nodes, and skip nodes that have been deemed unready for upgrade
  -f, --plan-file string              path to the installation plan file (default "kismatic-cluster.yaml")
      --restart-services              force restart cluster services (Use with care)
      --skip-preflight                skip upgrade pre-flight checks
