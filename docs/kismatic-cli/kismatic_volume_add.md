## kismatic volume add

add storage volumes to the Kubernetes cluster

### Synopsis


Add storage volumes to the Kubernetes cluster.

This function requires a target cluster that has storage nodes.

```
kismatic volume add size_in_gigabytes [volume name]
```

### Examples

```
  Create a distributed, replicated volume,
  named "storage01", a kubernetes StorageClass of "durable", with a 10 GB quota,
  grant access to any IP address starting with 10.10.
  kismatic volume add 10 storage01 -r 2 -d 2 -c="durable" -a 10.10.*.*
		
```

### Options

```
  -a, --allow-address stringSlice     Comma delimited list of address wildcards permitted access to the volume in addition to Kubernetes nodes.
  -d, --distribution-count int        This is the degree to which data will be distributed across the cluster. By default, it won't be -- each replica will receive 100% of the data. Distribution makes listing or backing up the cluster more complicated by spreading data around the cluster but makes reads and writes more performant. (default 1)
      --generated-assets-dir string   path to the directory where assets generated during the installation process will be stored (default "generated")
  -o, --output string                 output format (options "simple"|"raw") (default "simple")
  -r, --replica-count int             The number of times each file will be written. (default 2)
  -c, --storage-class string          The StorageClass to present for claims in Kubernetes. Classes should identify properties of volumes in business terms, such as 'durable' or 'fast-reads' (default "kismatic")
      --verbose                       enable verbose logging
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -f, --plan-file string   path to the installation plan file (default "kismatic-cluster.yaml")
```
